
I have a java 17 / gradle on groovy consuming from a kafka topic and write to elasticsearch 6.8 to an alias based on the "ProductType" field value.
working with a batch of messages.
1. read from kafka 
2. find the ProductType value
3. check if the alias with a prd_ prefix for the ProductType value
4. if it's doesn't exist, create the proper alias and index
5. write the batch into elasticsearch

please provide which unit tests u recommend


### Kafka Consumer
1. **Kafka Message Consumption Test**
   - Verify that the consumer correctly fetches messages from the Kafka topic.
   - Mock Kafka broker for testing.
   - Assert that the expected messages are consumed.

2. **Batch Processing Test**
   - Test that messages are grouped into batches correctly.
   - Simulate various batch sizes and ensure processing logic handles them.

### ProductType Extraction
3. **Field Parsing Test**
   - Test extraction of `ProductType` from message payloads.
   - Validate error handling for missing or malformed `ProductType` fields.

### Elasticsearch Alias Management
4. **Alias Existence Check**
   - Mock the Elasticsearch client.
   - Test whether the function correctly checks for alias existence based on the `prd_` prefix and `ProductType`.

5. **Alias and Index Creation**
   - Verify the alias and index creation logic:
     - Ensure the alias is created with the correct write index.
     - Handle conflicts or errors during creation gracefully.

### Batch Writing to Elasticsearch
6. **Successful Batch Write**
   - Mock Elasticsearch responses.
   - Test that the batch of messages is written to the correct alias.

7. **Partial or Full Failure Handling**
   - Simulate partial failures during batch writing.
   - Test retry logic or fallback mechanisms for failed messages (e.g., writing to a DLQ).

8. **Dynamic Routing to Alias**
   - Test that messages are routed to the correct alias dynamically based on the `ProductType`.

### End-to-End Flow
9. **Integration Test**
   - Simulate the entire workflow (Kafka consumption → alias handling → Elasticsearch writing).
   - Mock dependencies and validate correct processing for a range of scenarios.

### Edge Cases
10. **Empty Batch Handling**
    - Ensure the system gracefully handles empty batches without processing errors.

11. **Invalid ProductType**
    - Test scenarios where `ProductType` is missing, invalid, or malformed.

12. **Alias Name Conflicts**
    - Simulate cases where an alias already exists for a different index.
    - Ensure conflicts are handled gracefully.

### Performance and Scalability
13. **Large Batch Handling**
    - Test the system's ability to process large batches efficiently.

14. **High Throughput**
    - Verify performance under high message volume, ensuring no messages are lost or delayed.

Would you like examples or templates for any of these unit tests?
