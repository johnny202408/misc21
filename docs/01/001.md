Project Goal: Build a Java 17 project (pure java, without spring) using Gradle (Groovy) that integrates Kafka Connect to consume messages from a Kafka topic and push them to an Elasticsearch index.

Requirements:

Java Version: Use Java 17.
Configuration: java class reading from config.properties file, with java.util.Properties
Build Tool: Gradle with Groovy DSL.
Kafka Connect Integration:

Consumer should read messages from a Kafka topic (example-topic).
Messages should be indexed into Elasticsearch 6.8 alias.
the index name is determined by the ProductType field inside the JSON consumed from the kafka topic.
it should check if the alias exists and if it does not, create it before indexing.
the work should be in batches (configurable for number of messages and timeout).
please also provide a detailed large amount of unit tests

Plugins/Dependencies:
Include necessary dependencies for Kafka, Kafka Connect, and Elasticsearch.
Add plugins for managing Kafka Connect configuration (e.g., Confluent dependencies if needed).
Configuration:
Provide Kafka and Elasticsearch configurations in application.properties or application.yml.
Ensure Kafka topic and Elasticsearch index are configurable.
Task/Usage:
Provide Gradle tasks to run the application (bootRun or a custom task).
Demonstrate how to run the Kafka Connect flow locally or in a Docker setup if applicable.
Extras:
Use logging to monitor data flow.
Example configuration for retry or error handling if data cannot be consumed or indexed.
Output Expected:

A working Gradle (Groovy) build file (build.gradle) with dependencies and tasks.
Example Kafka Connect worker configuration.
Source code for connecting to Kafka and Elasticsearch using Kafka Connect.
Instructions to run the project locally.
